I am a Phd student  at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://fudan.edu.cn/) (2021.9-2025.6). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, video understanding, and multi-modal knowledge extraction and reasoning. Under the guidance of Academician [Qionghai Dai](https://ysg.ckcest.cn/html/details/8058/index.html) from Tsinghua University and Professor [Xiangyang Xue](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/3f/8a/c25907a278410/page.htm) from Fudan University, I have developed a deep understanding and expertise in these areas. I am currently seeking a faculty position where I can contribute to academic research and education.
